*DESCRIPTION*: The E-Learning Platform is a web-based application designed to enhance the online learning experience by offering features such as course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding. It allows users to browse and explore courses, with each course displayed in a structured card format, featuring a title, description, and a "Start Course" button. Users can track their learning progress via a visual progress bar that updates as they engage with video lessons. The video embedding functionality ensures seamless playback directly within the platform, offering a responsive design for desktop and mobile users. The platformâ€™s clean and user-friendly interface includes easy navigation to key sections like courses, progress, and profile. This project aims to provide an intuitive, accessible learning experience while laying the foundation for future features such as backend integration and user authentication.
